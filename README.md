CAP-analysis
=====

This open-source MATLAB-based code to extract and analyze characteristics of the compound action potential (CAP). Please see the [example_script_Frontiers.m](https://github.com/EIN-lab/CAP-analysis/blob/master/example_script_Frontiers.m) file for detailed instructions on how to use the script and analyze data.

Getting Started
---------------

### Neuroshare library

Users will also need to download the Neuroshare library, which allows to read MCD files.  This can be done manually, from the Multichannel Systems [website](https://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/neuroshare-library).

#### Files for examples and tests

The files used in the [script_for_example_data.m](https://github.com/EIN-lab/CAP-analysis/blob/master/script_for_example_data.m) can be downloaded manually through the GitHub repository [website](https://github.com/EIN-lab/CAP-analysis/raw/master/Example%20CAP%20recording/example_Ramp_1_10_25_50Hz.mcd).

Quick start guide
-------------------------------

For analysis of your own data find our quick start script [here](https://github.com/EIN-lab/CAP-analysis/blob/master/example_script_Frontiers.m).
